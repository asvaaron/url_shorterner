# URL short code Algorithm

In this project the Short Code algorithm applies a base64
encoding in the unique primary key **id** Base10 (decimal) value generated 
for the new url entity. The application rails model validates that the url string 
is not repeated and not null, this prevents coalitions and duplicates urls.

The base64 encode uses characters that goes from [0-9a-zA-Z].
It's important to mention that when using the Base62 function 
the encoding must be case insensitive. 
Otherwise, you won’t be able to differentiate “ABC” from “ABc”.
